### Why We Need Consumers

In Kafka, producers send messages to topics, but these messages need to be processed or used by applications. Consumers are responsible for reading these messages and performing actions, such as saving data, triggering workflows, or analyzing information. However, a single consumer can only handle a limited amount of data and may become a bottleneck if the volume of messages grows.

For example, if a topic has multiple partitions and high throughput, one consumer cannot process the data efficiently or in real time. This is especially problematic in systems that require low latency and high scalability.

### The Solution: Consumer Groups

To handle large volumes of data efficiently, Kafka introduces consumer groups. A consumer group allows multiple consumers to work together to read messages from a topic. Each consumer in the group is assigned specific partitions to ensure no overlap in processing. This way:

- The workload is distributed, enabling faster processing.
- It provides fault tolerance, as if one consumer fails, others can take over its partitions.
- It scales horizontally, as adding more consumers to the group increases the system's capacity to handle messages.
If a consumer in the group stops working, the remaining consumers take over its partitions, ensuring no data is lost. Consumer groups make it easy to scale message processing by adding more consumers to the group.

All consumers in the group share a group ID, which helps Kafka track their progress. Each group processes messages independently, so multiple groups can read from the same topic without interfering with each other. Consumer groups are a powerful way to handle large amounts of data efficiently and ensure reliability in distributed systems.


When the number of consumers are more than the total number of partitions in a topic, then the extra consumers will be kept in IDLE state by kafka.

### Consumer offsets

### What is Consumer Commit in Kafka?

When a Kafka consumer reads messages from a topic, it keeps track of the progress by maintaining an offset for each partition it reads. The offset is essentially a pointer to the next message to be consumed. To ensure fault tolerance and avoid processing the same messages repeatedly, consumers commit their offsets to Kafka

Why is Commit Important?

- **Avoid Re-Processing:** By committing offsets, the consumer avoids reading the same messages again after restarting.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Offsets stored in Kafka allow a consumer to resume from where it left off, even after a crash.
- **Load Balancing:** Commit offsets help ensure smooth partition rebalancing when new consumers join or leave a group.

### What is Auto Offset Reset?

In Kafka, **`auto.offset.reset`** is a consumer configuration setting that determines what happens when a consumer starts reading a partition but no committed offset is available. This situation can occur in the following cases:
- The consumer group is reading the partition for the first time.
- The committed offset has been deleted (e.g., due to retention policies).
- The offset is out of range (e.g., messages older than the topic's retention period have been deleted).

---

### Available Options for `auto.offset.reset`

### 1. `earliest`
- The consumer starts reading from the **beginning of the partition**.

### 2. `latest` (default)
- The consumer starts reading from the **end of the partition**, ignoring older messages.
- Suitable for real-time applications where only new messages are relevant.

### 3. `none`
- The consumer throws an exception if no committed offset is found.
- Useful for strict control where processing incorrect data is unacceptable.

---

### How It Works

- When a Kafka consumer starts, it checks for committed offsets for each partition.
- If a committed offset exists, the consumer resumes reading from that point.
- If no offset is available, the behavior depends on the `auto.offset.reset` setting.

---

## Example Scenarios

### `earliest`
If `auto.offset.reset=earliest`:
- The consumer reads all available messages from the beginning of the topic.
- Example Use Case: A data pipeline that must process historical data.

### `latest`
If `auto.offset.reset=latest`:
- The consumer ignores older messages and reads only new messages.
- Example Use Case: A real-time application processing live streams.

### `none`
If `auto.offset.reset=none`:
- The consumer throws an error if no offset is available.
- Example Use Case: Systems requiring strict offset management and error handling.

## Configuration Example

Hereâ€™s how to configure `auto.offset.reset` using the `kafka-python` library:

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'test-topic',
    bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
    group_id='test-group',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest'  # Options: 'earliest', 'latest', 'none'
)

for message in consumer:
    print(f"Partition: {message.partition}, Offset: {message.offset}, Value: {message.value}")
