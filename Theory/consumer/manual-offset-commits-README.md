# Kafka Manual Offset Commits and Processing Architectures

Manual offset commit strategies in Kafka enable fine-grained control over when offsets are committed during message processing. Different architectures handle message acknowledgment and offset commits in unique ways, depending on the requirements for reliability, performance, and fault tolerance.

## Processing Architectures

### 1. **At-Most-Once Processing (Offset Commit = 0)**

- The offset is committed **before** processing the message.
- If the processing fails, the message will not be retried because the offset is already updated.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Fast and simple.
  - Can lose data if processing fails.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications where occasional data loss is acceptable, such as logging systems.

#### Workflow:
1. Commit the offset.
2. Process the message.

### 2. **At-Least-Once Processing (Offset Commit ≥ 1)**

- The offset is committed **after** processing the message.
- If the processing fails, the message will be reprocessed when the consumer restarts.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Ensures no data loss.
  - May result in duplicate processing if a failure occurs after processing but before committing.
- **Use Case**: Applications where data integrity is critical, such as financial transactions or database updates.

#### Workflow:
1. Process the message.
2. Commit the offset.

### 3. **Exactly-Once Processing (Offset Commit ≤ 1)**

- Combines idempotent processing with careful offset management to ensure the message is processed **exactly once**.
- Relies on external systems (e.g., Kafka Transactions or idempotent writes) to handle duplicates during retries.
- **Characteristics**:
  - No data loss and no duplicate processing.
  - More complex and requires additional infrastructure or guarantees.
- **Use Case**: Critical systems where accuracy is paramount, such as billing or inventory management.

#### Workflow:
1. Begin a transaction.
2. Process the message and produce a result.
3. Commit the offset and the result atomically (e.g., using Kafka Transactions).

## Summary Table

| Processing Type        | Offset Commit Timing  | Data Loss | Duplicate Processing | Use Case                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **At-Most-Once**       | Before processing     | Yes       | No                    | Logging, monitoring                |
| **At-Least-Once**      | After processing      | No        | Yes                   | Financial transactions, ETL jobs  |
| **Exactly-Once**       | With idempotent logic | No        | No                    | Billing, inventory management      |

## Code Examples

### At-Least-Once Processing
```python
for message in consumer:
    try:
        # Process the message
        process_message(message)
        # Commit the offset after processing
        consumer.commitSync()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Processing failed: {e}")
