### Acknowledgment Settings for Kafka Producers

Producers can choose how Kafka confirms the delivery of messages using three acknowledgment levels:

    acks=0 (No acknowledgment): 
    
    The producer sends the message and does not wait for confirmation.
    It doesnâ€™t verify if the message was received.

    acks=1 (Leader acknowledgment): 
    
    The producer waits for a confirmation from the leader broker of the topic partition.
    Once the leader confirms receipt, the message is considered delivered.

    acks=all (Replica acknowledgment): 
    
    The producer waits until all in-sync replicas confirm receipt. 
    This ensures maximum data safety but may increase delay.
